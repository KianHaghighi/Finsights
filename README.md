The objective of this machine learning project is to develop a sentiment analysis model capable of analyzing tweets and extracting sentiment polarity to gain insights into public opinions about financial markets. By leveraging this sentiment analysis, we aim to create a trading strategy that utilizes live tweet data to inform investment decisions and potentially generate profitable trades.

This project seeks to address the following challenges:
1. Sentiment Analysis: Develop a robust sentiment analysis model capable of accurately classifying tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment categories, taking into account the nuances and challenges of sentiment analysis in the context of social media text.
2. Real-time Data Integration: Implement a system that can continuously monitor and analyze live tweets related to financial markets in real-time, ensuring efficient data retrieval and processing to support timely trading decisions.
3. Trading Strategy Development: Design and implement a trading strategy that utilizes the sentiment analysis results as a key input. The strategy should incorporate risk management techniques, such as position sizing, stop-loss orders, and target profit levels, to optimize trade execution.
4. Performance Evaluation: Assess the effectiveness of the sentiment analysis-based trading strategy by evaluating key performance metrics, such as profitability, risk-adjusted returns, and comparison against benchmark strategies or market indices.

By successfully addressing these challenges, this project aims to demonstrate the potential value of sentiment analysis in capturing market sentiment and utilizing it as a decision-making tool for trading. Furthermore, it showcases the integration of real-time data analysis and machine learning techniques in financial market applications, highlighting the ability to leverage social media sentiment for generating actionable insights and potentially improving trading performance.
